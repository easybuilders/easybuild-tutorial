<p align="center"><a href="https://easybuild.io"><img src="../../img/easybuild_logo_alpha.png" alt="EasyBuild logo" width="300px"/></a></p>

This page explains how you can prepare for the EasyBuild tutorial
that takes place at [ISC'21](https://www.isc-hpc.com/) *(registration required!)*.

## Prepared environment

Tutorial attendees will be able to log in to a prepared environment
where they can follow along with hands-on examples, or solve the
tutorial exercises.

*(more info on getting access coming soon)*

## Slack

We recommend joining the [#tutorial](https://easybuild.slack.com/archives/C014UFG2R43)
channel in the [EasyBuild Slack](https://easybuild.slack.com).

In this channel, you can:

* raise questions both during the live tutorial session, and afterwards;
* get help with following the hands-on examples or solving the exercises;

The `#tutorial` channel will remain available after the live tutorial
session.

You can self-request an invitation to join the EasyBuild Slack via
[https://easybuild-slack.herokuapp.com](https://easybuild-slack.herokuapp.com).
