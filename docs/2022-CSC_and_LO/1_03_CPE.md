On LUMI, the main programming environment is the HPE Cray Programming Environment (further abbreviated
as Cray PE). The environment provides several tools, including compilers, communication libraries, 
optmized math libraries and various other libraries, analyzers and debuggers.

The Cray PE is made available through *environment modules* tha allow to select particular versions of 
tools and to configure the environment in a flexible way.
