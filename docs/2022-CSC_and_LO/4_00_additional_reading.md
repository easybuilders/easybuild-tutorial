## HPE Cray Programming Environment

-   [LUMI documentation: "Developing" section](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/)
-   The Cray PE is mostly documented through man pages. There used to be some documentation on the
    Cray web site also but the documentation system got reworked after the merger with HPE.
    The documentation is now in the [HPE Support Centre](https://support.hpe.com/) where it
    is very difficult to find the right version of the documents.
-   The [PE-Cray](https://github.com/PE-Cray) GitHub project also provides some additional 
    documentation, including
    -   [some whitepapers](https://github.com/PE-Cray/whitepapers),
    -   [documentation for Cray OpenSMHEMX](https://github.com/PE-Cray/cray-openshmemx) and
    -   [information about Cray DSMML](https://github.com/PE-Cray/cray-dsmml)
    though much of that information ia also not updated regularly anymore.
